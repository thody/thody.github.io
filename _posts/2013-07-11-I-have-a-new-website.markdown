My personal site has been in a state of limbo for a while, as I played around with different ways
to build and maintain it. Despite best intentions, I don't post all that often, so I no longer
wanted to deal with a database, or pay for the hosting required for a more dynamic site. Hence,
I've switched over to using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, and I'm very happy so far.

Stay tuned while I crank out some of the posts I've been queuing up!
